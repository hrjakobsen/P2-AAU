	\section{The Problem in Context}
There are several problems related to steganography in the modern world of information technology. No matter if you are an activist, a politician, or a terrorist, there is often a need to send messages in a way that makes them difficult for others to read. Typically this involves some form of encryption of varying strength, but any form of encrypted text or other data can arouse suspicion. What if it was possible to send this data in a way where interceptors would not even know that a secret message was conveyed? 

	\section{Relation to Computer Science}
This project, which relates to steganography and its potential use on social media, requires working with groups from other studies. The fact that a software solution needs to be developed in parallel with other teams, means that the use of object-oriented programming becomes essential. This is primarily due to the vastness of the project, which requires separate modules to communicate. Encapsulation of data becomes important, when other teams are dependent on the input and output of the developed modules.
	
Saving data is an integral part of digital steganography, which means that
4t4t
File types -> Different representations of data
Algorithms ->
DMAT -> Big o, graph theory


\begin{itemize}
	\item We need to describe the problem very broadly
	\item Write about what computer science topics we will use
	\item Contextual questions
	\item Initiating problem 
	\item Short summary of how we are going to fulfil the themes and goals described in the curriculum
\end{itemize}
