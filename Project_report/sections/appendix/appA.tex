\chapter{LSB Experiment}
\label{app:A}
This is a digital appendix containing source code for a C\# programme. It is too large to fit into the report itself.
Instead the relevant Visual Studio Solution can be found at the following location:

\setlength{\parindent}{0pt} {
\path{Programmes\LSB_Experiment\LSB_Experiment.sln}\\

The programme in its executable form can be found at \\
\path{Programmes\LSB_Experiment\LSB_Experiment.exe}
}
