\section{Software Testing}
During the planning phase of the project we decided to continually test the code we wrote.

Our strategy for testing revolved around one member of the group creating tests, for each new component, method and logical statement.
The aim of this continual testing alongside the software development, was to catch errors and bugs, as soon as possible.
This would then in turn minimize time and effort otherwise used on debugging, and therefore also lead to a more stable product.
The aforementioned tests would additionally improve the maintainability of the software, allowing future changes and upgrades.

The construction of tests was done using the open source unit testing framework NUnit. 
Using this framework allowed the creation of tests to be streamlined and automated, allowing each group member to frequently test the new components they were creating.

% Maybe the first paragraph should be in design
% Plan to maybe add a "case study" with an example from our program
% Need to make some assumption regarding tests
