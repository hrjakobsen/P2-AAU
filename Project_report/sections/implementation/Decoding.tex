\section{Decoding}
As mentioned in section \ref{sec:DesignHuffman}, a \lstinline|StreamReader| reads from a file from the beginning towards the end.
Thus, the first thing we did in the decoding process was to read the Huffman tables from the JPEG file. 
\input{sections/implementation/Huffman.tex}
We do this four times, since there are four Huffman tables.

If the public method called \lstinline|decode()| is called, the method will call appropriate methods and sub-methods to decode the message hidden in the jpeg image with the Graph-Theoretic-Approach to Steganography.
The method \lstinline|findScanData()| returns a bitlist, which will be used by the method \lstinline|decodeScanData()|, and then returns the message to the user who called the method.
\input{sections/implementation/findScanData.tex}
\input{sections/implementation/decodeScanData.tex}
The value of the \lstinline|decodeScanData()| method, will be returned to the caller of the \lstinline|decode()| method.
