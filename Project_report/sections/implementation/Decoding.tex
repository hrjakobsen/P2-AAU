\section{Decoding}
As mentioned in section \ref{sec:DesignHuffman}, a \lstinline|StreamReader| reads from a file from the beginning towards the end.
Thus, the first thing we did in the decoding process was to read the Huffman tables from the JPEG file. 
\input{sections/implementation/Huffman.tex}
We do this four times, since we got four Huffman Tables.
