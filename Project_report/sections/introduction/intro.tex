\section*{Intro}
This project will focus on the topic of steganography and its uses in a digital context.
We chose steganography as a topic, as it is not something any of us has previously worked with nor have read much about. However, everyone was in agreement on the fact that it was an incredibly interesting subject to study, as there are so many options as to how it can be carried out, but also has some ethical questions surrounding the entire sending hidden messages process. The intentions behind sending these messages could potenitally be malicious but could also be benign.

With the rise of social media, and its use in our everyday lives, a social network would be an ideal place to send messages, which could raise less suspicion, if one's intentions were bad-natured as people share images and text with each other all day long. So one more picture would not look out of the ordinary. 

This discussion the group had on the various problems surrounding steganography and what it is ultimately used for, has resulted in the following initiating problem: 
"What obstacles arise when attempting to send hidden data across social media and which algorithms can be used to circumvent these?"
