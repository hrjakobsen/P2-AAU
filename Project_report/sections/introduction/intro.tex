\section*{Clustergroup}
We have during the project worked together with two groups from different studies, one from Math, another from ITC. 
The math team is researching different algorithms which is related to Graph Theory, and for Steganography as well, while the ITC group just has to implement a system which allows two devices to communicate without having direct access to each other.
The ITC group can thus use what we end up creating as a module for their communication protocol, and we can talk with the math team about the algorithms they research, help each other understanding the algorithm better, and implement it in a program which is able to create a stego image. 
All of our modules is able to stand as an individual project, but when combined, will form something greater
