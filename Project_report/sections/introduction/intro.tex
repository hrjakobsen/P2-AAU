\section*{Clustergroup}
During the project we have worked with two groups from different studies, one from mathematics, another from internet technology and computer systems (ITC). 
The maths team is researching different algorithms which is related to graph theory, and for steganography as well, while the ITC group has to implement a system which allows two devices to communicate without having direct access to each other.
The ITC group can thus use what we end up creating, as a module for their communication protocol, and we can talk with the maths team about the algorithms they research, help each other understanding the algorithm better, and implement it in a program which is able to create a stego image. 
All of our modules are able to stand as individual projects, but when combined, will form something greater.
