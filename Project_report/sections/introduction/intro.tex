\section*{Intro}
This project will focus on the topic of steganography and its uses in a digital context.
We chose steganography as a topic, as it was not something any of us has previously worked with nor have read so much about. However, everyone was in agreement on the fact that it was an incredibly interesting subject to study, as there are so many options on how it can be done, but also some ambivalent thoughts surrounding the ethics of sending hidden messages. The intentions behind sending these messages could be malicious but could also be benign.

With the rise of social media, and its use in our everyday lives, it would be an ideal place to send messages via a social network, which could raise less suspicion, if one's intentions were bad-natured as people share images and text with each other all day long on various networking sites.

A discussion on the various problems surrounding steganography and what it is ultimately used for, has resulted in the following initiating problem: 
"What obstacles arise when attempting to send hidden data across social media and which algorithms can be used to circumvent these?"
