\section{Cluster Group}
This section will focus on the cluster group, which was supposed to be a large part of the process. It will describe the various concerns that our group had before and during the project, as well as contain an analysis of the process that we went through. 

\subsection*{Motive}
Before the groups for this project were formed, everyone was encouraged to read a project catalogue containing all the project proposals available for the project.
The steganography entry in the catalogue contained a paragraph that read (translated from Danish):
\begin{quote}\textit{This project proposal is provided to first-year students from three different subjects: Mathematics, Computer Science/Software Engineering, and Internet Technologies and Computer Systems. The groups who choose the steganography entry are required to make their own project based on their respective subjects, but the end goal is to be able to coordinate the projects, so that each one of them are a part of an overall project. By doing it this way, this project will resemble the challenges that you will face after graduation.}\end{quote}

Working across studies posed an interesting challenge because it would prepare us for working with people with different abilities and knowledge.

The three groups in our cluster group were Mathematics (MAT) and Internet Technologies and Computer Systems (ITC), and us, Computer Science (DAT). 
At our first meeting we decided to make three independent projects, each able to stand on their own. 
This had the potential to give us a wider understanding of the topic of steganography as we would see it from different sides instead of only from a programmer's perspective.
