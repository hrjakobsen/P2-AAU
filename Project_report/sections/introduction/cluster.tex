\section*{Cluster group}
During the project we have worked with two groups from different studies from Aalborg University, one from Mathematics, another from Internet Technology and Computer Systems (ITC). 
The maths team researched different algorithms related to graph theory and steganography, while the ITC group was required to implement a system allowing two devices to communicate without having direct access to each other.
The ITC group could use our product through an API in their communication protocol, and the maths team supplied us with insight into the algorithms they researched, which allowed us to implement more advanced versions of them, ultimately helping both groups to understand the algorithm better.
In the end, all of our modules are able to stand as individual products, but when combined form something greater.
