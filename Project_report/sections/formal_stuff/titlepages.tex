}{% the abstract
  This report contains an analysis of the problem with Steganography and how it can be detected through Steganalysis. 
  It will also give some insight in something more contextual, such as who would benefit from it and why there is a need for it.
   During the report some steganographic experiments have been conducted and the image format known as JPEG has been thoroughly analysed. These investigations have lead to the creation of the final programme, which has been developed to work on this very format during the writing of this report. 
   The programme is able to embed a message secretly within the image to make it as difficult as possible to detect by the human eye, using a graph theoretic approach from the branch of Mathematics known as Discrete Mathematics.
