\section{Representing the Graph}
There are multiple ways of representing a graph. 
Firstly we wanted to use an adjacency list and for each vertex, keep a list of its neighbours. 
Having the edges implied by the adjacency list instead of having actual Edge objects that not only would the program use less memory, the process of removing all neighbours of a vertex becomes very efficient, a process we must often do in the ``graph-theoretic approach to steganography''. 
As efficient as this would be, there are major problems with doing this. 
By implying the edges instead of storing them, we cannot save any additional information about what the edge actually describes. 
In our case, an edge means that there is a switch that would make both vertices contain the given message if the modulo operation is applied with the correct $m$-value. 
But having each vertex contain two values means that there are four possible switches between two vertices as shown in figure \ref{fig:graphSwitches}.

Another way to show the representation of a graph, is simply a list of vertices and a list of edges. 
Each edge then simply stores what vertices it connects. 
This makes it very easy to loop through all edges, but at the same time makes it computationally expensive to remove certain edges from the graph (ie. 
to remove all edges between two vertices).

There are always other types of adjacency lists where each vertex keeps a list of the edges connecting them to other vertices. Here we get the advantages of having an actual \lstinline|Edge| object, while still being able to quickly find all neighbours of a vertex.

We have chosen to use the method of simply keeping a list of all vertices, instead of each vertex keeping a list of its neighbour. There are three main reasons for ding this.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Difficult removing all edges touch vertices
	\item Only do half the vertex-pairs
	\item Having to sort all edges by weight
\end{itemize}
