\subsection{Find the Huffman Tables from a JPEG file}
\label{sec:DesignHuffman}
As previously mentioned in section \ref{sec:jpegStudy}, the Huffman tables are placed in the beginning of a JPEG file, prior to the scan-data session. 
Since a stream reader reads from the beginning of a file towards the end, it's important to do things in much the same way. 
First step is to look for the $DHT$ marker $0xFFC4$, since we then know what comes next, is all the information about the Huffman table. 
To read in all the information we needed, and store it in a table, we came up with the following algorithm with a little inspiration from \cite{HuffmanDecoding}.
