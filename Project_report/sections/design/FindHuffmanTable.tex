\subsection{Find the Huffman Tables from a JPEG file}
\label{sec:DesignHuffman}
To find the encoded text using the Graph-Theoretic Approach, the first step is to read in the Huffman tables from the JPEG-file, making it possible to look up the code written in the scan-data session of the file.
As mentioned in section \ref{sec:jpegStudy}, the Huffman tables are placed in the beginning of a JPEG-file, prior to the scan-data session.
Since a \lstinline|StreamReader| reads from the beginning of a file towards the end, it is important to proceed in much the same way.
The first step is to look for the $DHT$ marker $0xFFC4$, since we then know that what follows is all the information about the Huffman table.
To read in all the information we need, and store it in a table, we came up with algorithm \ref{huffmanAlgo} with a little inspiration from \cite{HuffmanDecoding}.
