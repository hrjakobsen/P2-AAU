\subsection{Find the Huffman Tables from a JPEG file}
\label{sec:DesignHuffman}
To find the encoded text using the graph-theoretic method, the first step is to read the Huffman tables from the JPEG-file, making it possible to look up the code written in the scan-data segment of the file.
As mentioned in section \ref{sec:jpegStudy}, the Huffman tables are placed in the beginning of a JPEG-file, prior to the scan-data segment.

The first step is to look for the DHT marker 0xFFC4, since what follows is the information about the Huffman table.
To read the information we need, and store it in a table, we came up with algorithm \ref{huffmanAlgo} based on an article \citep{HuffmanDecoding}.
