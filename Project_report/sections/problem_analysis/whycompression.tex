\section{Why use image compression?}
Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Imgur all use some form of image compression to reduce the size of user-uploaded images.
This is partly shown in table \ref{tab:PNG-compression}.
But why do these sites compress images?
An obvious reason is to make room for more data on the sites' servers.
This benefits the sites themselves.
Another reason is that not every social media user has an unlimited amount of internet data, which means that there is a certain pressure on the websites to be lightweight for the benefit of their users.
In fact, according to a report from 2012, \cite{chetty_2012}, a vast majority of homeowners with internet access in South Africa have caps on their data plans.
Unlimited data is fairly recent in South Africa as well, since all homeowners were capped prior to February 2010, according to the same report.
Saving data for the users' benefit is therefore important for a lot of websites, perhaps even more than so for social media sites, which often place focus on user-uploaded pictures.\improvement{For the sake of mobile users as well}
