\section{Data types}
When trying to hide data it is important to understand the various data types one might use for the cover file and the hidden information.

\subsection{JPEG}
Joint Photographic Experts Group or JPEG is a widely used image format, which stems from the compression method used as it is able to reduce the file size of an image substantially.
This compression has drawbacks though, in that it is a lossy compression method, lossy means ``with losses'' to the image quality.
Because the JPEG compression method is lossy, we cannot use normal methods for steganography without taking certain countermeasures into account, which can preserve the hidden data.
\iffalse{TODO: need to specify which countermeasures and rewrite the ending}\fi


\subsection{PNG}
Portable Network Graphics or PNG, which was created in 1996 as a better alternative to the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF).
PNG offers a wide range of colour depths, from 24-bit (8 bits per channel) to 48-bit (16 bits per channel) and can even get up to 64-bit when a alpha channel is added.
Whereas GIF is limited to only 8-bit indexed colour.
The compression method used for the PNG image format is lossless, so no data is lost under compression.
Because the compression is lossless and PNG is widely used on the internet makes it ideal as a cover for use in steganography.


\subsection{BMP}
BMP file format is a raster graphics image file format and is capable of storing two-dimensional digital images of arbitrary width, height and resolution, both monochrome and colour, in various colour depths. 
One can also use data compression, alpha channels and colour profiles if needed.
All of these options make it easy to work with in regard to steganography, the problem arises in that the file size of these images can become quite large in comparison to other more used image formats, and because of this, it is not used as widely as the other aforementioned image formats.
