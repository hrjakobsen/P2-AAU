\section{Data types}
!!Add intro to data types!!

\subsection{JPEG or JPG}
Joint Photographic Experts Group or JPEG is a widely used image format, this stems from the compression method used as it is able to reduce the file size of an image substantially.
This compression has drawbacks though, in that it's a lossy compression method, lossy means ``with losses'' to the image quality.
Because the JPEG compression method is lossy, we can not use normal methods for steganography without taking certain countermeasures into account, which can preserve the hidden data.
\iffalse{TODO: need to specify which countermeasures and rewrite the ending}\fi


\subsection{PNG}
Portable Network Graphics or PNG, which was created in 1996 as a better alternative to the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF).
PNG offers a wide range of colour depths, from 24-bit (8 bits per channel) to 48-bit (16 bits per channel) and can even get up to 64-bit when a alpha channel is added.
Whereas GIF is limited to only 8-bit indexed colour.
The compression method used for the PNG image format is lossless, so no data is lost under compression.
Because the compression is lossless and PNG is widely used on the internet makes it ideal as a cover for use in steganography.
