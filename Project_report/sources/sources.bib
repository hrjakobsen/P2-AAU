  Abstract                 = {Watermarking, as we define it, is the practice of hiding a message about an image, audio clip, video clip, or other work of media within that work itself. Although such practices have existed for quite a long time—at least several centuries, if not millennia—the field of digital watermarking only gained widespread popularity as a research topic in the latter half of the 1990s. A few earlier books have devoted substantial space to the subject of digital watermarking [171, 207, 219]. However, to our knowledge, this is the first book dealing exclusively with this field},

  Abstract                 = {This article seeks to open dialogue about the utility of resource mobilization theory in explaining social movements and their impact by exploring the use of social media in the 2011 Egyptian revolution through a limited case study analysis. It argues that social media played an instrumental role in the success of the anti-government protests that led to the resignation of the country’s dictatorial leader, and calls for further examination of the proposed incorporation of social media as an important resource for collective action and the organization of contemporary social movements.},
